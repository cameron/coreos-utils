## Scripts for bootstraping a CoreOS machine into a useful state
- enable the daemon's remote API
- generate a TLS certificate and client/server keys for secure remote communication
- install unit files (e.g., containers that run at startup)
  
### Wishlist
- CLI for selecting from a list of DOCKER_HOSTs
- if it gets any more serious, rename to tug 
- automate installation of TLS cert/keys
